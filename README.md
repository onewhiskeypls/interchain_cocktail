# Interchain Cocktail of binaries/cli tools
This is just a random assortment of Interchain binaries written so whoever wants to use them can.  On a later date I will document and breakdown the commands and their flags

## Recipe (v1)
- 1 part gaiad v7.0.2
- 1 part osmosisd v10.0.1
- 1 part junod v8.0.0
- 1 part terrad v2.0.1
- 1 part kujirad v0.4.0

### Optional ingredients
- 1 part secretcli v1.3.1

## Notes
1. This will build up to and use 5.4GB of space on your machine once the container is built, I will attempt to optimize this.
    - Update: I failed
2. Dockerfile was built on ubuntu:latest with chrony added
    - This was established with a default of options 2 (America) and 85 (Los_Angeles).
    - If you would like to reconfigure it execute the following:
        - `dpkg-reconfigure tzdata`
    - This was then uploaded to Docker Hub under onewhiskeypls/ubuntu-chrony
    - I was not able to get debconf-set-selections to auto-input the selections, so I opted to just create an image for this
3. Obligatory verify the script contents, do not simply trust me.
    - You could take this script and build a different ubuntu w/ chrony
    - `apt install -y chrony`
4. A lot of the apt package installs were consolidated into 1 line
    - See the worksheet.txt

## How to run
Notes
1. You will need Docker on your machine
    - https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
    - https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
2. You will need git installed OR find your way to cloning this repo
    - https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

- Create the image
Note: *You may need `sudo` in front of these commands depending on your account's permissions*

```
docker build -f Dockerfile-ICCT -t icct_i .
```

- This will create the container then start the container
```
docker create --name icct -i icct_i
docker start icct
```

If you're on an Apple silicone based machine you may need to execute like so
```
docker create --platform linux/amd64 --name icct -i icct_i
docker start icct

```

- Choose one of the following in working here:
If you want to connect to the container and operate in it
```
docker exec -it icct bash
```

If you wish work outside of the container, you may do so here
```
docker exec -i icct [COMMAND]
```
Example query:
```
docker exec -i icct gaiad version
```
Alternatively, you may write a script that runs the queries for you and sorts out the data.

**Note: Most data returned is encrypted, I will draft a separate doc going over that**

- Optional while in the cli
You may execute the following to ensure it's working properly
```
gaiad version
gaiad q account cosmos1scwcfre6h4c7epkyrdfegpeaz8umqldl50gn8w --node https://rpc.cosmoshub.pupmos.network:443 -o json

#secretcli q account secret1dn540qzhd3kuml0t09zr575yam74tzhqtdf7se --node https://scrt-rpc.blockpane.com:443 -o json
```

### Optional - Installing secretcli
Note: I had a few troubles with this one, so don't be surprised if this barfs. This was likely due to needing to install the SGX.  It threw errors often when building other packages, so I wasn't comfortable allowing it to automate
```
# "INSTALL secretcli"
# "zombied from https://docs.scrt.network/docs/node-runners/node-setup/install-secretd"
# you may switch the DBTYPE - rocksdb OR goleveldb
# Note: rocksdb  - works on ubuntu, did not work on m1mac
# Note: goleveldb - worked on m1 mac, had issues getting it to work on ubuntu

SECRETDBTYPE=rocksdb
cd ~/dev
wget "https://github.com/scrtlabs/SecretNetwork/releases/download/v1.3.1/secretnetwork_1.3.1_mainnet_${SECRETDBTYPE}_amd64.deb"
apt install -y libsnappy1v5
dpkg -i secretnetwork_1.3.1_mainnet_${SECRETDBTYPE}_amd64.deb
rm secretnetwork_1.3.1_mainnet_${SECRETDBTYPE}_amd64.deb
secretcli q account secret1dn540qzhd3kuml0t09zr575yam74tzhqtdf7se --node https://scrt-rpc.blockpane.com:443 -o json
```
